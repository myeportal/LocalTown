What is LTB?
----------------

Local Town Blockchain is a forked version of Litecoin, which is a Bitcoin clone, using scrypt as a proof-of-work algorithm.
 - 2.5 minute block targets
 - subsidy halves in 840k blocks (~4 years)
 - ~23400000000 total coins, with 7.8B premined for governance development

The rest is the same as Bitcoin.
 - 50 coins per block
 - 2016 blocks to retarget difficulty

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Litecoin client sofware, see http://www.litecoin.org.

License
-------

Litecoin is released under the terms of the MIT license. See `COPYING` for more
information or see http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.

Development process
-------------------

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think
their feature or bug fix is ready.

If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the Litecoin
development team members simply pulls it.

If it is a *more complicated or potentially controversial* change, then the patch
submitter will be asked to start a discussion (if they haven't already) on the
[mailing list](http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=bitcoin-development).

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing.
Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if the code doesn't
match the project's coding conventions (see `doc/coding.txt`) or are
controversial.

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Litecoin.

Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test. Please be patient and help out, and
remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write unit tests for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code.

Unit tests for the core code are in `src/test/`. To compile and run them:

    cd src; make -f makefile.unix test

Unit tests for the GUI code are in `src/qt/test/`. To compile and run them:

    qmake localtown_QT_TEST=1 -o Makefile.test localtown-qt.pro
    make -f Makefile.test
    ./localtown-qt_test

Abstract:

1. Introduction:
Local Town Blockchain Cryptocurrency (LTBC) is a revolutionary concept that harnesses blockchain technology to create community-specific digital currencies. This paper highlights the potential benefits of LTBC, including economic growth, localized monetary policies, and enhanced community engagement. By empowering local communities with their own cryptocurrency, a new era of financial self-sufficiency and collaboration can be achieved.

2. Understanding Local Town Blockchain Cryptocurrency:
Blockchain technology forms the foundation of LTBC. Its decentralized, transparent, and immutable nature ensures secure transactions within the community. LTBC is designed with features like low transaction fees, fast settlement times, and user-friendly interfaces to facilitate widespread adoption.

3. Benefits of LTBC:
LTBC offers numerous advantages to local communities, including economic stimulation through incentivizing local spending, control over monetary policy tailored to local needs, improved engagement between residents and businesses, and reduced friction in transactions due to blockchain's transparency and security.

4. Implementation Strategies:
Successful LTBC implementation involves establishing effective governance models, distributing tokens fairly, forming partnerships with local businesses, and educating the community about blockchain and cryptocurrency. These strategies ensure smooth integration and adoption.

5. Potential Challenges and Mitigations:
Regulatory compliance, security risks, and volatility are potential challenges that LTBC initiatives might face. By collaborating with regulatory bodies, implementing robust security measures, and exploring mechanisms for stability, these challenges can be addressed.

6. Case Studies:
Case studies illustrate how LTBC can be tailored to different community needs. Towns A, B, and C demonstrate how LTBC can boost local businesses, fund community projects, and empower underbanked populations, respectively.

7. Future Outlook:
The scalability and interoperability of LTBC systems, coupled with the integration of smart contract capabilities, could further enhance community-driven initiatives. Collaboration with regional and national initiatives can lead to a network of interconnected LTBCs.

8. Conclusion:
LTBC represents a pioneering step towards community empowerment, economic growth, and sustainable development. Communities are encouraged to explore LTBC's potential, foster collaboration, and embrace the transformative possibilities of blockchain technology.

This whitepaper provides a comprehensive overview of the Local Town Blockchain Cryptocurrency concept, its benefits, challenges, implementation strategies, and real-world case studies. As communities continue to explore innovative ways to enhance local economies, LTBC stands as a promising avenue for their aspirations.
