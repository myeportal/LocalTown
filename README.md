Preface
The Local-Town Project Launch ICO white paper is available on the website local-town.com

LTB is a decentralized peer-to-peer, layer 1 blockchain, as forked by LTC from Sunny King’s Peercoin, which itself was derived from Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin. 
This blockchain runs on a scrypt algo-rythym, and will be minable by anyone with a scrypt miner. Pools can be made, or exchanges can list it openly on their markets

Local-Town MARKETING MODEL: $LTB
Strategy/Long term plans: 
Our strategy to market is to offer a decentralized way to acquire blockchain tokens, thru either mining or decentralized exchanges. From time to time we may or may not offer free giveaways or rewards or airdrops of tokens to help spread the decentralized aspect. 
Tokens will be (in dev) available for P2P exchange directly or thru dex models. 
Businesses can exchange goods for services using the barter method. 
IE. I would like to offer you 1 tokens for 1 gallon of milk and a dozen eggs. (example only)

LTB stands for:
LOCAL TOWN BARTER 

What is LFB?
LTB is Local Town Blockchain, a local town layer 1 barter blockchain, where anyone can use to trade and barter for goods and services.

How does LTB work?
Wallets will be used to store and send or receive the blockchain tokens.
Anyone who wants to trade can barter with sellers who want to sell their goods and services. Essentially, people can barter for goods and services using the blockchain token, similiar to the Ithaca, NY "Hours", an Ithaca "hour" is pegged to 1:10USD.
1 LTB will be pegged to what the open market is offering, and anyone with a computer or phone will (in future dev) be able to mine for tokens using scrypt hashing.
